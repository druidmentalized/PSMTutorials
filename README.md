# PSMTasks – Java Physics Simulations

This repository contains a set of Java-based physics simulations developed for the **PSM (Programming in Java with Simulations)** course at PJAIT.

Each task focuses on a different numerical method or physical phenomenon, supported by visualization using `JFreeChart`.

---

## 📁 Structure

Each task is located under its own package inside the `src/main/java/org/psm/` directory:

- `task1/` – Sine function approximation using Taylor series.
- `task2/` – Projectile motion simulation using Euler and MidPoint methods.
- `task3/` – Pendulum motion simulation using Improved Euler (Heun) and RK4 methods, including energy conservation analysis.
- `task4/` - Rolling object motion simulation using MidPoint method, which allows for different inertia objects calculations. 
- `task5/` - Moon–Earth–Sun orbital simulation using MidPoint method.
  Models Earth’s orbit around the Sun and the Moon’s local orbit around Earth,
  combining them to show realistic lunar motion.
- `task6/` – String oscillation simulation using the MidPoint method. Models wave propagation on a discretized string
  fixed at both ends, computes displacement and velocity updates over time, and visualizes shape evolution and energy 
  conservation.
- `task7/` – Stationary heat distribution on a square plate using the finite difference method.
  Solves a 2D Laplace equation using linear system formulation and LU decomposition to compute the temperature profile given fixed edge temperatures.
- `task9/` – Fractal plant drawing using L-systems and turtle graphics.
  Implements a recursive L-system with symbolic rewriting, visualized using turtle-like drawing logic in a Swing GUI.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- **Task 1**:  
  - Numerical approximation of the sine function using **Taylor series expansion**.  
  - Compares the approximation with Java’s built-in `Math.sin`.

- **Task 2**:  
  Simulates **2D projectile motion** under gravity and air resistance.
    - Implements **Euler's method** and the **Midpoint method**.
    - Visualizes trajectories using `JFreeChart`.

- **Task 3**:  
  Simulates a **mathematical pendulum** using:
    - **Improved Euler method (Heun's method)**
    - **Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4)**  
      Calculates and plots:
    - **Potential energy**
    - **Kinetic energy**
    - **Total mechanical energy**
      to compare conservation behavior across methods.

- **Task 4**:
  Simulates a rolling object (e.g. solid sphere or cylinder) descending an inclined plane without slipping.
  Implements the Midpoint method (improved Euler) to integrate:
  - **Translational motion along the incline**
  - **Rotational motion due to rolling**  
  Calculates and visualizes:
  - **Center of mass trajectory**
  - **Rotational point trajectory**
  - **Inclined surface geometry**
  - **Ball outline (circle projection at start)**
  - **Potential, kinetic (translational + rotational), and total energies**  
  Uses `JFreeChart` to plot all spatial and energetic data**

- **Task 5**:
    Simulates the Moon–Earth–Sun orbital system using the Midpoint method.  
    Models:
    - **Earth’s orbit around the Sun using Newtonian gravity**
    - **Moon’s local orbit around Earth, treated as a two-body system**
    Combines both to produce a realistic lunar trajectory in global coordinates and outputs:
    - **Earth and Moon orbits**
    - **Fixed Sun position**  
    Uses `JFreeChart` for clear spatial visualization.
- **Task 6**:
     Simulates transverse oscillations of a discrete string using the Midpoint method.  
     Models:
     -	**Wave propagation on a string fixed at both ends**
     -	**Midpoint integration for both displacement and velocity**
     -	**Finite difference approximation for the second spatial derivative**
     Computes and visualizes:  
     - **String shape at multiple time snapshots**
     - **Kinetic, potential, and total mechanical energy over time**  
     Uses `JFreeChart` to plot the string’s spatial deformation and energy evolution.
- **Task7**:
  Solves the 2D Laplace equation for steady-state heat distribution over a square plate using:
  - **Finite difference discretization**
  - **Matrix system formulation (A·x = b)**
  - **LU decomposition with Apache Commons Math**  
  Computes and visualizes:
  - **Temperature distribution inside the plate**
  - **Color-mapped heatmap via `JFreeChart`**  
  Fixed temperatures are applied on all four edges, and the system is solved efficiently using linear algebra tools.
- **Task 9**:
  Generates and visualizes a fractal plant based on an L-system (Lindenmayer system).  
  Features:
  - **Symbol rewriting rules** with recursive growth (e.g. `"X → F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X"`)
  - **Turtle graphics** for interpreting drawing instructions (`F, +, -, [, ]`)
  - Branching structures via a stack to simulate natural growth
  - Dynamic **zooming based on iteration count** to fit the drawing into view
  - Optionally supports **step-by-step rendering** for animation-like visual evolution  
  The simulation is rendered using Swing and Graphics2D.
